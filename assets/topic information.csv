Abortion ,"About six-in-ten U.S. adults (58%) said in a 2018 survey that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 37% who said it should be illegal. There are substantial partisan and ideological divides on abortion, with Democrats much more likely than Republicans to say it should be legal in all or most cases. When it comes to the Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 ruling, about seven-in-ten Americans (69%) said Roe v. Wade should not be completely overturned, ","In a December 2017 survey, roughly half of Americans (48%) said having an abortion is morally wrong, while 20% said they think it is morally acceptable and 31% said it is not a moral issue. These views also differed by religious affiliation: About three-quarters of evangelical Protestants (77%) said having an abortion is morally wrong, but just 24% of religiously unaffiliated people agreed."
Budget & Economy ,"In 2018, the government spent $4.11 trillion. the attacks on 9/11 led to the War on Terror. It's added $2.4 trillion to the debt since 2001. It almost doubled annual military spending. It rose from $111.9 billion in 2003 to a peak of $150.8 billion in 2019. That includes the defense department budget and off-budget emergency spending, and increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs.","Large U.S. financial institutions reaped a windfall from the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Now foreign banks are pushing for favorable treatment from Treasury. With the clock ticking toward a potential debt default, federal budget negotiators are maneuvering to isolate the man seen as the common enemy: Mick Mulvaney."
Civil Rights ,"American civil rights movement, mass protest movement against racial segregation and discrimination in the southern United States that came to national prominence during the mid-1950s. This movement had its roots in the centuries-long efforts of African slaves and their descendants to resist racial oppression and abolish the institution of slavery. Although American slaves were emancipated as a result of the Civil War and were then granted basic civil rights through the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution, struggles to secure federal protection of these rights continued during the next century. ","Ultimately, Obama’s approach to the world and, arguably, his appeal to many voters were transracial, grounded in a sophisticated understanding of the complex nature of racial identity that was no longer merely dichotomous—no longer simply a matter of black or white. Given the deeply rooted racial conflicts of the American past, however, it is unlikely that Obama’s election signaled the start of a postracial era without divisive racial issues and controversies."
Corporations ,"As already noted, the undue influence of corporate interests on the functions of government is not new, and Sen. Whitehouse’s book explains how Americans have faced and overcome this threat before. America’s founders recognized the danger of corporate capture: In 1816, Thomas Jefferson warned the new republic to “crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of their country.” ","In the first presidential contest after the Citizens United decision, 84 percent of Americans agreed that corporate political spending drowns out the voices of average Americans, and 83 percent believed that corporations and corporate CEOs have too much political power and influence. This aligns with more recent research showing that 84 percent of people think government is benefitting special interests, and 83 percent think government is benefitting big corporations and the wealthy."
Crime ,"Crime rates vary among U.S. states. In 2011, the state with the lowest violent crimerate was Maine, with a rate of 123.2 per 100,000 residents, while the state with the highest violent crime rate was Tennessee, with a rate of 608.2 per 100,000.","Violent crime in the U.S. has fallen sharply over the past quarter century. The two most commonly cited sources of crime statistics in the U.S. both show a substantial decline in the violent crime rate since it peaked in the early 1990s. One is an annual report by the FBI of serious crimes reported to police in approximately 18,000 jurisdictions around the country. The other is an annual survey of more than 90,000 households conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which asks Americans ages 12 and older whether they were victims of crime, regardless of whether they reported those crimes to the police."
Drugs ,            The turn of the century witnessed a heightened awareness that psychotropic drugs have a great potential for causing addiction.  The abuse of opium and cocaine at the end of the 19th century reached epidemic proportions.  Local governments began prohibiting opium dens and opium importation.  In 1906 the Pure Food and Drug Act required all physicians to accurately label their medicines.  Drugs were no longer seen as harmless remedies for aches and pains.,"  Opioid abuse and addiction has been the subject of much hand wringing in the past two or three years, but the problem is much broader and deeper than that. There are over 22 million individuals in the U.S who have a substance abuse problem (including alcohol).  At any given moment, there are about 4.5 million individuals who have a substance use disorder due to the abuse of illicit and prescription drugs."
Education ,"Education in the United States is provided in public, private, and home schools. State governments set overall educational standards, often mandate standardized tests for K–12 public school systems and supervise, usually through a board of regents, state colleges, and universities.","However, despite all these attributes, the U.S. faces many challenges. On the global stage, U.S. hegemony has eroded over the past decade, and China and India are projected to overtake the U.S. in terms of economic output by 2050. The country also remains mired in the war in Afghanistan, the longest running war in its history. Domestically, income inequality is among the worst of the major advanced economies. Furthermore, the bitter 2016 presidential election, in which businessman Donald J. Trump defeated former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, exposed deep fissures in American society politically, racially, culturally, and regionally—and has caused some to call into question the strength of American democracy."
Energy & Oil ,Easy availability of natural resources has helped the industrialization process of the United States to a great extent. The huge variety of natural resources contributes a substantial share of the revenue of the US federal government. The ready availability and abundance of natural resources also provide the nation with a comparative advantage in the global financial markets. ,"Due to the non-renewable nature of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and petroleum, the use of renewable sources of energy has gained substantial popularity in United States in recent times. The federal and state governments of United States have put stress on conservation of natural resources. "
Environment ,"Environmental issues in the United States include climate change, energy, species conservation, invasive species, deforestation, mining, nuclear accidents, pesticides, pollution, waste and over-population. Despite taking hundreds of measures, the rate ofenvironmental issues is increasing rapidly instead of reducing.","Humans have been playing a devastating role in ruining the natural resources and intervening atmospheric activities. Being the third largest country in the world, the United States of America has emerged as one of the significantly affected regions from environmental concerns and issues."
Families & Children ,Three in 4 children ages 12 and under would be income-eligible for child care assistance.The median family’s child care payment would not exceed $45 per week.All child care workers would earn a living wage. Three-quarters of child care workers currently earn below a living wage and would therefore see a pay increase.,"Congress included the largest-ever funding increase for the nation’s child care assistance program—the Child Care and Development Block Grant—in the fiscal year 2018–2019 budget, which serves as a down payment on the CCWFA.8 While this funding increase represents a critical first step that will lead to real improvements for families, a more comprehensive solution is needed to help all families afford and access quality child care."
Foreign Policy ,"The foreign policy of the United States is its interactions with foreign nations and how it sets standards of interaction for its organizations, corporations and system citizens of the United States.

The officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States, including all the Bureaus and Offices in the United States Department of State,[1] as mentioned in the Foreign Policy Agenda of the Department of State, are ""to build and sustain a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community""",Japan and South Korea continue a historic dispute while Turkey exits the F-35 program amid tensions with the United States. A political program that does not envision statehood for the Palestinians could reverse the Gulf Arab states’ tentative warming toward Israel. A political program that does not envision statehood for the Palestinians could reverse the Gulf Arab states’ tentative warming toward Israel.
Free Trade,"Beginning with the Theodore Roosevelt administration, the United States became a major player in international trade, especially with its neighboring territories in the Caribbean and Latin America. Today, the United States has become a leader of the free trade movement, standing behind groups such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (later the World Trade Organization).","Free trade increases access to higher-quality, lower-priced goods. ...
Free trade means more growth. ...
Free trade improves efficiency and innovation. ...
Free trade drives competitiveness. ...
Free trade promotes fairness."
Government Reform ,"Government reform means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc. ... Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale.","Partisanship and ideology tends to be the manner in which we group Americans as we approach an election. Yet, this paper suggests that talking about what government does and how well it can deliver on its promises may be a powerful message to Americans who are looking for something different. In that sense, while some voters may want to Make America Great Again, many simply want to grow the federal government and make it functional again."
Gun Control ,Proponents of increased gun control in the United States argue that limiting access to guns will save lives and reduce crime; opponents insist that it would actually do the opposite by preventing law-abiding citizens from defending themselves against armed criminals.,"Though regulations vary from state to state, there are a few key conditions for obtaining guns in the US. The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), which regulates firearms at the federal level, requires that citizens and legal residents must be at least 18 years of age to purchase shotguns or rifles and ammunition."
Health Care ," Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. 58% of US community hospitals are non-profit, 21% are government owned, and 21% are for-profit.[2] ","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent $9,403 on health care per capita, and 17.1% on health care as percentage of its GDP in 2014. Healthcare coverage is provided through a combination of private health insurance and public health coverage (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid). The United States does not have a universal healthcare program, unlike other advanced industrialized countries"

Healthcare coverage is provided through a combination of private health insurance and public health coverage (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid). The United States does not have a universal healthcare program, unlike other advanced industrialized countries","Terrorist groups continue to inspire, enable and direct their followers to spread chaos using homemade weapons and by striking soft targets and crowded places. They also remain focused on conducting more sophisticated attacks using conventional weapons as well as new technologies and tactics. DHS is committed to staying a step ahead of our enemies, and an informed and vigilant public remains one of the Department’s greatest assets in protecting the homeland."
Immigration ,The Immigrant Visa Process. Foreign citizens who want to live permanently in the United States must first obtain an immigrant visa. This is the first step to becoming a lawful permanent resident. Immigrating to the United States is an important and complex decision.,"Today, 57% of Republicans say that if the U.S. is too open to people from around the world, “we risk losing our identity as a nation.” Many South Africans are dissatisfied with the state of their democracy. Confidence in some civic institutions declined from 1990 to 2013. Majorities in top migrant destination countries say immigrants strengthen their countries. Yet publics are divided on immigrants' willingness to adopt their host country's customs."
Infrastructure & Technology ,"America’s deficient roads, bridges and transit systems bring tangible economic consequences to U.S. businesses, with ramifications acutely felt in every household as well. And these effects will continue to grow unless the nation pumps significant investment into its crumbling transportation infrastructure. By 2020, businesses will pay $430 billion in increased transportation costs. U.S. exports will shrink to the tune of $28 billion annually, and inpidual household incomes would experience a related hit, with a $7,000 annual reduction predicted. ","America’s infrastructure is at a crisis point, as illustrated by the Interstate 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis on Aug. 1, 2007. During that Wednesday evening’s rush hour, the bridge spanning the Mississippi River suddenly gave way, killing 13 people and injuring 145. "
Jobs ,"Will the policy make a real difference in job creation in the next 24 months?
Is the policy effective and efficient?
How is the policy funded?
Is the policy at the appropriate scale to produce a substantial number of jobs?","For 17 years leading up to the collapse, reports cited structural problems with the bridge, and the federal government rated it as “structurally deficient” — a rating given to approximately 75,000 other U.S. bridges in 2007."
Principles & Values ,"Achievement, efficiency, material comfort, nationalism, equality and the supremacy of science and reason, over faith. There are certain ideals and values, rooted in the country’s history, which many Americans share. These are: FREEDOM, INDIVIDUALISM, PRAGMATISM, VOLUNTEERISM, MOBILITY, PATRIOTISM, PROGRESS, AMERICAN DREAM.","As we mark fifty years since the Apollo 11 mission landed Americans on the Moon, capturing the imagination of the world, our Nation is again on the verge of a new bold era in science and technology. Breakthroughs in medicine, communications, transportation, physics, engineering, biology, and many other fields, will help tackle the greatest challenges of our time and allow Americans to live safer, healthier, and more economically prosperous lives."
Social Security ,"Social Security is the foundation of economic security for millions of Americans—retirees, disabled persons, and families of retired, disabled or deceased workers. About 169 million Americans pay Social Security taxes and 61 million collect monthly benefits. About one family in four receives income from Social Security.","The average monthly Social Security benefit in June 2017 was: $1,391 a month for retired workers;

$1,172 a month for disabled workers;
$2,278 a month for a disabled worker and a spouse;
$2,664 a month for a widowed mother and two children."
Tax Reform ,"American businesses will become more competitive around the world. The business community has long called for lower rates for all businesses, full and immediate expensing, and a territorial tax system because we know these elements are the pro-growth reforms our economy needs to thrive… Our country will reap the benefits of this once-in-a-generation achievement for years to come.",
War & Peace ,"Given the contentious debate that continues to surround America’s involvement in Vietnam, now fifty years after Lyndon Johnson’s fateful decision to send ground combat troops to Southeast Asia, commenting on the future of warfare obliges conjecture without much evidence. Yet for uniformed officers considering strategic issues and the use of military force, these questions surely are as sensible as they are unavoidable","$1,391 a month for retired workers;"
Welfare & Poverty,"The United States is considered the richest country in the world, and yet millions of its residents live in poverty. Poverty is measured in two ways – absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty looks at the goods and services someone (or a family) cannot obtain.
